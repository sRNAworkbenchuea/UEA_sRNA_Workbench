            <h1>New miRCat Projects</h1>

            <p>Using miRCat for the first time to create a new project will first show the pre-processing window.</p>

            <p><img src="../images/ScreenShots/mircatOpenOptions.png" alt="miRCat pre-processing"/></p>

            <p>miRCat requires as input two FASTA files: the sRNA sequence file, with
              and a corresponding genome for the organism that is
              being studied.</p>

            <p>A user then has the option to enable the pipelining functionality of the sRNA Workbench in order to directly pre-process the sRNA data.
              If desired the user can <a href="./filter.html">Filter</a> the data and/or <a href="./ad_rem.html">Remove the Adapters</a> from the data.
              However, if the data has already been through the pre-processing procedure, for example if the stand alone versions of the tools had been used,
              a user can skip this by leaving the respective check-boxes unticked.</p>

            <p>Before processing, miRCat maps the sRNA sequences to
              the genome, using PatMaN. However, if the file has already been aligned using the stand alone <a href="./seq_align.html">Sequence Alignment</a>
              tool miRCat will detect this automatically providing the .patman extension remains on the file name.</p>

            <p>If a user desires all the files created throughout the pre-processing procedures to be retained, an additional file path can be populated with the
              location for the data. However, if this box is left blank all the pre-processing files will be marked for deletion on exit of the program.</p>
