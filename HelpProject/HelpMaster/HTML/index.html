            <h1>Welcome to the UEA sRNA Workbench</h1>

            <h2><p>RNA silencing is a complex, highly-conserved, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanism
                that tunes gene expression. It was originally studied as a defence mechanism against pathogens
                in plants and later studied extensively due to its ability to regulate cancer-related genes.
                RNA silencing is mediated by molecules known as small RNAs (sRNAs).</p>

              <p>The UEA sRNA workbench is a new simple to use, downloadable sRNA software package that will perform
                a complete analysis of single or multiple-sample sRNA datasets from both plants and animals. </p></h2>
